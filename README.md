# Input-Output

> A Java project focused on practicing input and output operations, including reading from and writing to files, handling user input, and stream management.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

**Input-Output** is part of a collection of learning exercises developed to strengthen understanding of Java's I/O API. It explores various ways of interacting with external data, such as:

- Reading and writing text files
- Using `Scanner` for console input
- Buffered streams for performance
- Exception handling during file operations

This project serves as a hands-on introduction to core I/O mechanisms in Java.
